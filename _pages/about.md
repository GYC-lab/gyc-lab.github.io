I am a Ph.D. student in **Fluid Mechanics**. My research focuses on **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)**, wall-bounded turbulence, and data-driven modeling. I enjoy building efficient simulators and physically consistent models for complex flows.

**Interests:** turbulence modeling, DNS/LES, transition prediction, scientific ML (PINN/Neural ODE/UDE), rough-wall aerodynamics.

**Tools:** OpenFOAM, Fortran (F77), MATLAB, Python.

Inline favorite equation (Navier–Stokes): $\partial_t \mathbf{u}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}=-\nabla p/\rho+\nu\nabla^2\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{f}$
